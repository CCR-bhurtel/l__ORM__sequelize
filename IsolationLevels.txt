Database isolation refers to the ability of a database to possible a transaction to execute as if there are no other concurrently running transactions
 (even though in reality there can be a large number of concurrently running transactions).

when multiple transactions are created in a program and run parallelly then there can 
arise irreleaent situations. 
for example, (Dirty Read) there are two transactions t1 and t2, 
t1 tranasction tries to write a data lets say data A, w(A)
and parallely tranasction t2 tries to read it, say R(A);

if t2 tries to read if before it has been created from tranasction t2 the logic becomes irrelavent
The situation is called violations
There are many mainly three types of voilations namely
(Dirty Read, Non Repeatable Read, Phantom)

Dirty Read:- the above violation is example of dirty read

Non Repeatable Read:- lets say tranasction t1 reads a column of a row and finds it's value to be 10
and now t2 updates the the data. when t1 again reads the table, it will find its's value differ from the original one.
This phenomenon is known as non repeatable read voilation.

Phantom:-When if t1 first reads the data values with query Q(c), where c is condition, if may get two rows.
Now transaction t2 updates the table and adds a row that fits the above condition. Now if again t1 tries to read the table one extra column
will appear as a phantom. This phenomenon is phantom voilation.

We have different isolation levels in SQL that may or maynot allows the above violations.
Isolation levels      Dirty Read      Non Repeatable Read     Phantom

Read Uncommited       possible           possible             possible                     

Read Commited         not possible       possible              possible

Repeatable Read       not possible       not possible          possible

SERIALIZABLE          not possible       not possible          not possible
